    Do you know the real meaning of the words Kung Fu? Or have you simply formed an impression of what Kung Fu is from television and the movies? Here, in this school by an martial arts expert, you will learn not only the important concepts of Kung Fu, and fascinating historical backgrounds, but the basic hand and foot techniques, all to be practiced and exhibited without anyone being harmed.<br><br>
    
    Ving Tsun Kung Fu, the most popular and respected system in existence today, was founded by a women self defense expert, Yim Wing Chun; who lived in China centuries ago and who felt that the existing systems were too rigid and required too much strength for the average person. So she developed her own martial art, stressing above all a healthy mind and a healthy body.<br><br>
    
    In this system you will discover the vital centerline and economy of movement theories, the one and only punch taught in Ving Tsun, the stances, the arm and hand blocks and attacks, and the kicking techniques and blocks. At the same time, the true meaning of Kung Fu will become more and more clear to you and will make the mastery of various techniques even easier.

    <span style="font-size: 18px;"> This is the only fist punch taught in the Ving Tsun system. Simple, yet devastating when delivered properly, it is like a “arrow on a spring.” thrust your fist forward with a quick snapping action of your elbow. After impact, and at full extension of the arm, withdraw the fist sharply with a slight bending of your elbow. The bottom three knuckles are the striking surface. Jin Choi can be used to attack and defend simultaneously</span>

 <p style="font-size: 20px;">  
The art of sticking hands is an exclusive training method of the Ving Tsun system. In this exercise you learn to defend the centerline with two hands and in the most efficient manner. Here the opponents are shown rolling their hands, the preliminary stage before the actual Chi Sao. Within the limits of Chi Sao are certain skills that must be required in order to execute Ving Tsun fighting techniques with maximum efficiency. The hands must develop a “mind” of their own so that they act smoothly, instinctively, and correctly.<br><br><br>

A skilled practitioner of Chi Sao does not tell his hands what to do. The hands act on their own, attacking when they feel an opening, and defending when they sense an attack. Chi Sao serves as an invaluable guide to correct hand positioning and the use of correct angle with minimum of wasted motion while developing a sensitivity of mind and bod

 <p style="font-size:20px">
The written history of Ving Tsun appears to have begun with a doctor named Leung Jan who lived in Foshan, a town in southern China. One of his renowned disciples was Chan Wah Shun (AKA Jow Chin Wah), who in turn taught the system to Ip Man. Later, it was Ip Man who brought Ving Tsun Kung Fu from mainland China to Hong Kong, from which time we date the beginning of modern Ving Tsun Kung Fu.

Ip Man’s Kung Fu was practically unknown in the British colony of Hong Kong until he happened to demonstrate his techniques to Lueng Shan, an established and highly respectable practitioner of martial arts who lost no time in becoming Ip Man’s first Hong Kong disciple. The news of this unique self-defense art spread quickly in martial arts circles.

During the first years in Hong Kong, Ip Man’s Kung Fu “Family” was small but strong. Ving Tsun’s rapid rise in popularity was at times resented by the followers of other systems. Challenges were frequently made and Ip Man’s disciples had to be in constant readiness for combat. This early group of students gained valuable experience while establishing reputations as formidable fighters. A young member of this group destined to introduce Ving Tsun Kung Fu into the United Sates was the late Bruce Lee.

With the passing of time Ip Man’s students became instructors, and they in turn developed students of their own. The Ving Tsun Kung Fu Clan  now has the largest following in Hong Kong. The once little known style has become one of the most popular martial arts in the world today.

  Miguel Hernandez founded the Ving Tsun Kung Fu Club in 1995 to bring together a community of extraordinary martial artist rooted in the Moy Yat tradition and students who desire a disciplined physical practice of awareness and self-study.

  As a young adult, Miguel came to Kung Fu and to the Ving Tsun technique in 1977. He left his first class feeling like his body and mind had been put back together as crystal clear painting. He fell in love with it and continued exploring the Ving Tsun style.
  
  He began his training at 1000 Flatbush, Brooklyn, NY under the tutelage of Sifu Jason Lau. After Sifu lau relocated to Atlanta, GA in 1979, Miguel assisted in teaching for two years at the Flatbush School. In Spring of 1989, Miguel continued his study of Kung Fu at the Moy Yat Ving Tsun Kung Fu Headquarters of New York with the late, world renowned Grandmaster Moy Yat. Miguel was fortunate to travel and assist the Grandmaster on many of his trips to China, Hong Kong, Europe, Canada, Brazil, and across the United States until his Sifu’s passing in 2001. Miguel has been a Ving Tsun instructor since 1995 and taught at The Soho Ving Tsun Studio, Sunset Park Ving Tsun Studio, and from his Sporting Goods store before opening the Ving Tsun Kung Fu Club. Miguel’s Kung Fu, in teaching and practice, is deeply influenced by Moy Yat’s method. He competed in the 3rd World Chinese Koushu (Kung Fu ) Championships in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1980; and in 1997 and 1998 coached two fighters (Robert Kollbeck: 190lbs and Albert Perez: 160lbs ) to First place in the U.S. International Koushu Championship Tournament in Baltimore, MD.
  
  While teaching at and running the Ving Tsun Kung Fu Club in Sunset Park Brooklyn, Miguel continues to explore Ving Tsun’s application of science, art, and philosophy technique privately, and to study with and be inspired by his Ving Tsun mentors and Kung Fu brothers.
